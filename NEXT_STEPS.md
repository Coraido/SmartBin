## 📝 What to Do Next (When You Have Equipment)

### Step 1: Update WiFi Credentials

Open `arduino_code/SmartBin_ESP32/SmartBin_ESP32.ino` and replace lines 13-14:

```cpp
// Current:
#define WIFI_SSID "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

// Change to your WiFi:
#define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFiName"      // Example: "MyHomeWiFi"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourPassword"   // Example: "password123"
```

**Important Notes:**
- WiFi name is case-sensitive!
- ESP32 only supports 2.4GHz WiFi (not 5GHz)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces

---

### Step 2: Hardware Setup

#### Connect the Components:

**Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):**
```
VCC  → 5V
GND  → GND
TRIG → GPIO 5
ECHO → GPIO 18
```

**Servo Motor:**
```
VCC (Red)    → 5V
GND (Brown)  → GND
Signal (Orange) → GPIO 25
```

**Buzzer (NEW - Add this!):**
```
Positive (+) → GPIO 26
Negative (-) → GND
```

**ESP32 Power:**
```
USB Cable → Computer (for programming and power)
```

---

### Step 3: Upload Code to ESP32

1. **Connect ESP32** to computer via USB
2. **Open Arduino IDE**
3. **File → Open** → Select `SmartBin_ESP32.ino`
4. **Tools → Board** → Select "ESP32 Dev Module"
5. **Tools → Port** → Select your COM port (e.g., COM3, COM4)
6. Click **Upload button** (→)
7. Wait for "Done uploading" message

---

### Step 4: Monitor Serial Output

1. **Tools → Serial Monitor**
2. Set baud rate to **115200**
3. You should see:
   ```
   SmartBin System Starting...
   Connecting to WiFi...
   Connected with IP: 192.168.x.x
   Firebase signup successful
   SmartBin System Ready!
   Distance: XX cm | Fill Level: XX% | Status: EMPTY
   ```

---

### Step 5: Test the System

#### Test 1: Hand Detection (Auto Lid)
- Place hand within 10cm of ultrasonic sensor
- ✅ Lid should open
- ✅ Wait 3 seconds
- ✅ Lid should close

#### Test 2: Fill Level Detection
- Place objects in bin
- ✅ Watch Serial Monitor show increasing percentage
- ✅ Check Firebase Console for updated data

#### Test 3: Full Bin Alert
- Fill bin to 80% or more
- ✅ Buzzer should beep
- ✅ Status changes to "FULL"

#### Test 4: Flutter App Real-time Sync
- Run Flutter app: `flutter run -d chrome`
- ✅ App should show real-time data
- ✅ Fill level updates automatically
- ✅ Status changes reflect immediately

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Reference

### If ESP32 won't connect to WiFi:
```cpp
// Try this temporarily to see WiFi networks:
WiFi.scanNetworks(); // Add this in setup() to see available networks
```

### If Firebase won't connect:
- Check Database URL ends with `/`
- Verify API key is correct
- Ensure Realtime Database is created (not Firestore)
- Check Firebase Rules are set to test mode

### If buzzer doesn't beep:
- Check polarity (+ to GPIO 26, - to GND)
- Try active buzzer if passive doesn't work
- Test with LED first to verify GPIO works

### If servo doesn't move:
- Make sure it's getting 5V power
- Try adjusting `closeAngle` and `openAngle` values
- Test servo separately first

## 📋 Quick Checklist for Next Session

When you return to work on this:

- [ ] Have ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, servo, and buzzer ready
- [ ] Update WiFi credentials in code (lines 13-14)
- [ ] Connect all components to breadboard
- [ ] Upload code to ESP32
- [ ] Open Serial Monitor to verify connection
- [ ] Check Firebase Console for data
- [ ] Run Flutter app
- [ ] Test all features

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test components individually first** - Make sure each sensor/actuator works before combining
2. **Keep Serial Monitor open** - It shows real-time debugging info
3. **Use Firebase Console** - Monitor data being sent from ESP32
4. **Check power supply** - Servo needs 5V, might need external power if too many components
