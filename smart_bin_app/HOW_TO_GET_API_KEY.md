3. Click the blue **"Register app"** button

---

### Step 4: Get Your API Key

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",        ‚Üê COPY THIS!
  authDomain: "smartbin-c8ef7.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "smartbin-c8ef7",

  messagingSenderId: "4310803131389",
  appId: "1:4310803131389:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
};
```

**Copy the `apiKey` value!**

Example: `AIzaSyDxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

1. Click **"Continue to console"** 
2. Now go back to Project Settings ‚Üí General tab
3. You should now see your **Web API Key** displayed!

‚úÖ Project ID: smartbin-c8ef7
‚úÖ Project Number: 4310803131389
‚úÖ Web API Key: AIzaSyDxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  ‚Üê You just got this!

```

## üéØ What to Do Next

**Once you have the API Key:**

1. ‚úÖ Save it in a safe place
2. ‚úÖ You'll use it for ESP32 later
3. ‚úÖ Continue with Step 4: Create bins
4. ‚úÖ Open your app: http://localhost:8081

---

## üîç Where to Find API Key Later

If you need to find it again:

1. Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings
2. General tab
3. Scroll to "Your apps"
4. Click on "SmartBin Web" (your web app)
5. You'll see the config snippet with the API key

Or:

1. Look in your Flutter project
2. File: `lib/firebase_options.dart`
3. Search for `apiKey`
4. It's already there! Flutter CLI added it automatically

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the </> icon"
- Make sure you're in Project Settings ‚Üí General tab
- Scroll down to "Your apps" section
- Look for buttons with platform icons (Web, iOS, Android)
- The web icon looks like: `</>`

### "I already clicked Register but didn't save the key"
- Go to Project Settings ‚Üí General
- Under "Your apps", click on "SmartBin Web"
- You'll see the config snippet again
- Copy the apiKey from there

### "Can I use my app without the API key?"
- Your Flutter app will work fine (it has the key in firebase_options.dart)
- But you **NEED** the API key for ESP32 hardware setup
- So make sure to save it!
